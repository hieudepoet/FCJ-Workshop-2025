# APT Magic

## A Serverless AI Platform for Image Generation and Social Interaction

---

### 1. Executive Summary

**APT Magic** is a serverless AI-powered web application designed to enable users to generate, personalize, and share artistic content such as AI-generated images. The platform integrates with AI foundation models via **Amazon Bedrock** (Claude Haiku 3 and Stability AI) and provides a seamless web experience using **Next.js (SSR)** hosted on **AWS Amplify**.

The MVP version focuses on real-time image generation and sharing, while the **Future Design** aims to scale with **SageMaker Inference**, **Step Functions**, and **AWS MLOps pipelines** for advanced model orchestration and automation.

APT Magic is developed as a modern, cost-efficient, and secure AWS-native architecture for small to medium user bases, with planned expansion into enterprise-grade AI orchestration.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

#### What’s the Problem?

Most AI image generation platforms are costly, rely on opaque third-party APIs, and offer limited personalization.
Developers and creators often face high latency, lack of transparent model management, and limited control over user data security.

#### The Solution

APT Magic leverages **AWS serverless architecture** to deliver:

* Real-time AI image generation through **Amazon Bedrock Claude Haiku 3** and **Stability AI**.
* Secure user authentication and content management using **Amazon Cognito** and **DynamoDB**.
* Scalable API handling via **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**.
* Low-latency global delivery with **CloudFront CDN** and **WAF protection**.

Future upgrades will include **Step Functions orchestration**, **SQS/SNS decoupling**, **SageMaker Inference pipelines**, and cost-efficient CI/CD via **CodeBuild**, **CodePipeline**, and **CloudFormation** — transforming APT Magic into a fully automated MLOps platform.

### 3. Solution Architecture

#### **MVP Architecture**

The MVP is a **fully serverless architecture**, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness.

**Core AWS Services:**

* **Route53 + CloudFront + WAF** — Secure global access and caching.
* **Amplify (Next.js SSR)** — Hosts the frontend and server-side rendering layer.
* **API Gateway + Lambda Functions** — Manage backend logic:

  * Social Post API
  * Completion Handling
  * Image Processing API
  * Subscription API
* **Amazon Cognito** — User authentication and access control.
* **Amazon S3 + DynamoDB** — Data persistence and image storage.
* **Amazon Bedrock (Claude Haiku 3 & Stability AI)** — Foundation model integration for LLM and image generation.
* **Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, CloudTrail** — Security, logging, and monitoring.

**Security**

* **WAF + IAM policies** for traffic filtering and role-based access control.

---

#### **Future Design (Enhanced Architecture)**

APT Magic will evolve into an **AI orchestration platform**, introducing new layers for automation, resilience, and model lifecycle management.

**New Services to be Added:**

* **AWS Step Functions** — To orchestrate asynchronous workflows such as:

  * Multi-step AI image generation (prompt validation → inference → result upload).
  * Payment confirmation → model processing → notification.
* **Amazon SQS** — For reliable message queuing between async Lambda tasks.
* **Amazon SNS** — For real-time event notifications to users or administrators.
* **Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)** — For rate limiting and caching of frequent inference requests.
* **Amazon SageMaker Inference** — For hosting custom fine-tuned models and managing model endpoints.
* **AWS CodePipeline + SageMaker Pipelines** — To automate MLOps: model training, evaluation, and deployment.
* **AWS WAF & Shield Advanced** — For DDoS protection and advanced security filtering.

**CI/CD + MLOps**

* **CodePipeline + CodeBuild + CloudFormation** for infrastructure deployment and automation.
